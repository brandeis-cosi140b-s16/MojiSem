Abstract:

Research into emoji in textual communication has, thus far, focused on highfrequency usages and the ambiguity of interpretations.
Investigation of emoji uses across a wide range of uses can divide them into different linguistic functions: function and content words, or multimodal
affective markers. We report on an annotation task on English Twitter data with the goal of classifying emoji usage by these categories, and on the effectiveness
of a classifier trained on these annotations. We find that it is reasonably easy to train a classifier to tell the difference between content words and multimodal markers,
but that sub-classification of these multimodal emoji needs more data and a more feature engineering.
